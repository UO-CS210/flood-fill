"""
Grid display.  

Displays a rectangular grid of cells, organized in rows and columns
with row 0 at the top and growing down, column 0 at the left and 
growing to the right.  A sequence of unique colors for cells can 
be chosen from a color wheel, in addition to colors 'black' and 'white'
which do not appear in the color wheel. 

Michal Young (michal@cs.uoregon.edu), October 2012, 
for CIS 210 at University of Oregon.  Revised November 2013
for Sudoku with subgrids. 

Uses the simple graphics module provided by Zelle, which in turn 
is built on the Tk graphics package (and which should therefore be 
available on all major Python platforms, including Linux, Mac, and 
all flavors of Windows at least back to XP).
